# blindgame
A simple game written to help show a blind student what they could do. Designed for blind users.

A text based adventure game written in python. This is intended to be for a relatively young middleschool audience, so frameworks and advanced programming paradigms are kept to a minimum. Some OOP may be necessary.
Uses pyttsx3 for speech output.

The game is designed to be blind. All output to the user is to be read aloud with pyttsx3. There will be a deaf mode that will output to screen at some point.
